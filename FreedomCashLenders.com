The Department of Education is restarting student loan collections starting May 5, but there are ways for borrowers who have missed a few payments to avoid defaulting.

About 4 million borrowers are currently in late-stage delinquency, meaning they have not made a payment for 91 to 180 days, according to the Department of Education.

Federal student loans are considered in default after 270 days of non-payment. Experts say borrowers should avoid defaulting, as they could have their wages garnished and many resolution options are unavailable.
