If borrowers cannot afford their payments, even with a more affordable repayment plan, they can apply for forbearance or deferment to temporarily pause their payments.

Deferment and forbearance are available for economic hardship or other circumstances that make it hard for a borrower to pay monthly. These options allow for a temporary suspension of payments, but borrowers can only pause their payments for a certain amount of time.

Additionally, interest will still accrue for some loans while in deferment or forbearance. The main difference between the types of payment pauses is interest accrual.
